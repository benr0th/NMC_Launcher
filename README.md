# NMC_Launcher
A basic launcher for the KH2 mod Nobody May Cry. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/benr0th/NMC_Launcher/releases/tag/latest), put the .exe in the **Music Tool** folder and launch it. It will not work anywhere else (currently at least).<br>
Requires [.NET 6.0 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0).

## Features
- Launches Music_GUI and PCSX2 together.
- Options to start in Fullscreen and/or launch without the PCSX2 config window.
- Automatically focuses PCSX2 after Music_GUI launches to avoid having to do it manually when you launch both simulatneously.
- Includes ability to download [Music GUI Volume Saver](https://github.com/benr0th/Music-GUI-Volume-Saver) if you don't have it already.

## Known Issues
- Only works when put in the Music Tool folder. Launching Music_GUI.exe outside it seems to cause issues, will try to fix it if I can figure it out.

## Future Plans
- This is a very rudementary start, so the UI is essentially placeholder. I am not a great designer so if someone wants to contribute, feel free and I will include you in the credits.
- I will try to incorporate the volume saver into the launcher itself so you don't have to download another program.
